We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",

        "I think tools like this are useful for exposing systematic bias so that we can discuss issues and work to make systems more equitable. I find it difficult to picture an ethical application of that kind of automated bail processing. By basing future decisions off of prior judgements on protected characteristics like sex or race I actually think you'd be quite likely to run into discrimination lawsuits if anything. Obviously our current criminal justice system is extremely far from perfect, but in theory decisions are meant to be made based on specific cases with knowledge of legal precedent. Maybe you could develop a program to make a more \"logical\" recommendation based on case law using a sophisticated neural network assessing the details of the crime, but basing important decisions with dramatic outcomes for people's lives on their demographic characteristics seems highly unethical and much more likely to perpetuate existing biases than to correct them. I've read plenty about how judges are as human as the rest of us and their decisions are not always based solely on rationality. For instance, studies have found that their decisions can even be impacted by things like the \"hungry judge effect\" or recent losses by their favorite sports team (https://www.vera.org/news/game-day-injustice-judges-dole-out-harsher-sentences-after-home-team-upset), factors which disproportionately affect certain groups. So we definitely do need to find ways to make the justice system more fair for people going through it, but I do not think this would be a good method. "
